    <p>Hello, my name is Vy Vo and I'm a junior at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Management Information Systems. <br><br>
    I like Math and I also like to figure out how things work. I'd love to work as a software engineer after graduation.</p>
    <h3 style="background-color: bisque">Where I'm from</h3>
    <p>I'm from Vietnam and I've moved to the US for over 4 years. I've always lived in Nebraska since I came here. I went to high school in Lincoln and moved to Omaha for college.<br><br>
    I didn't like Nebraska much when I first came here. I grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, a city with a small area yet a huge population of around 8 million people. I was always used to the traffic, crowds, noise, and tall buildings. Nebraska, Lincoln specifically, was nothing like that.<br><br>
    However, as time passed, I gradually grew an interest in living in Nebraska. Especially after I moved to Omaha, I felt like this city is very much decent. I met a lot of new people in this diversed college. There are good places for food from different ethnicities. I also got to discover more about nature through hiking and road trips. Omaha has become my second best favorite city. The only thing I'm still trying to get used to is the cold weather and the snow. I always try to avoid driving in snow days as much as possible. Hopefully I'll get better at it.</p>
