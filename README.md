# ISQA 3900 Activity 2
In this activity, I created two web pages, index.html and homemaha.html. The main webpage has information about myself, and the second web page has more specific details about places that I like to go to in Omaha. I like the design part of this activity which I can be creative with color and styles. However, the challenge I faced was to write about myself. Writing is always a challenge to me. I didn't  know what other information about myself that I should put on the page.
